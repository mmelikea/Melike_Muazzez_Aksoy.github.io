Hello! 

My name is Muazzez Melike Aksoy. I am 2nd year Master of Public Health student in Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. My department is Biostatistics and my certificate is Advanced Epidemiology.

I am both a graduate student and a research assistant. My former research experiences include areas in health disparities, social determinants of health, socioeconomic disadvantage, and discrimination. I am currently working as a research assistant in Department of Neurology at Columbia Medical Center on a research about sedentary behaviors, physical activity, social determinants of health and Alzheimer's disease risk. In all of my research experiences, I worked with longitudinal data.

I like reading, photography, traveling, hiking, coloring, listening to music. I have four cats! Here are the pictures of my cats! Here is a link to see my travel pictures [Photos](https://Melike_Muazzez_Aksoy.com)
